Software Architecture
=====================

Objectives of the Software Architecture
---------------------------------------

The objectives of the software architecture are:

 - Designed for testability: The software parts have interfaces which allow to test that part individually.
 - A use case driven approach: The architecture shall be centered on use cases and not depend on implementation details.
 - Flexible structure: The software shall not be hard to adjust to changing hardware, development frameworks or external/third party libraries.
