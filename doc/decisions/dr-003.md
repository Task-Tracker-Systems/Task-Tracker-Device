# DR003 Test Granularity and Stubbing Challenges {#dr_003}

## Context

Our software development project faces challenges in designing unit tests due to issues with the granularity of tests and stubbing dependencies.

Note that we structure our software into packages (see 
[Implementing a Plug-in Architecture](<\ref plugin_architecture> "Implementing a Plug-in Architecture")
).
Those packages are technically implemented as [(private) libraries][3] (see 
[Root Directory for the Package's source files](<\ref dr_002> "Root Directory for the Package's source files")
).

## Challenges with Stubbing

Our initial assumption was to write unit tests for individual units.
However, challenges arose, particularly regarding the granularity of "unit" tests envisioned.

### Option 0: Testing individual units {#dr_003_o0}

The original plan was to write tests which cover single units.
A unit in this context is for example a class or a translation unit.
A test would be compiled along the unit under test (UUT), linked together and executed.
The build configuration should be defined within the [`platformio.ini` configuration file][1].

A limitation of PlatformIO has been experienced.
Specifically that for test builds not only the UUT, but the whole library in which it resides, is included to the build (see [issue #4849][2]).
This prevents to stub dependencies of the UUT to other translation units within the same library.
It is impossible to test individual units isolated from others this way.

### Option 1: Filter source files {#dr_003_o1}

In order to overcome the limitations from 
[option 0](<\ref dr_003_o1> "option 0")
one can use a [`library.json`][JSON] manifest file for each library in combination with the [`extraScript` option][4] to filter files.
This way individual files could be filtered for specific build targets.

It can be expected that this approach will be effortfull, as filters have to be implemented for each individual unit.

[4]: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/manifests/library-json/fields/build/extrascript.html "documentation of `extraScript`"

### Option 2: Split units into separate libraries {#dr_003_o2}

Another way to circumvent the the limitations from 
[option 0](<\ref dr_003_o1> "option 0")
would be to separate each unit into an individual library.
This way only the UUT would be added to the test script for the test build.

A major disadvatage would be that the planed structuring of the software packages into directories would get lost.
This would render the analysis of the software structure more difficult.

### Option 3: Test integrated units {#dr_003_o3}

Test features using units and its dependencies to a certain degree:

Either include (using [`lib_deps`][5] in [the project configuration][1]):

- **Option 3a)** all dependencies compatible to the test environment
- **Option 3b)** all dependencies compatible to the test environment, but no 3rd party library adapters
- **Option 3c)** only those dependencies which inevitably come as part of the library in which the UUT resides

Omitted dependencies need to be substituted with stubs.

## Comparison of Options

Stubbing dependencies presents technical difficulties.

## Options Considered

1. **Test Individual Units**
   - Pros:
     - Highest test coverage.
   - Cons:
     - Requires extensive effort for stubbing.
     - May lose structural elements when separating units into dedicated libraries.

2. **Test Integrated Units**
   - Pros:
     - Tests more code at once.
     - Allows indirect testing of dependencies.
   - Cons:
     - Test results are more coarse.
     - May require additional unit tests to achieve high coverage.

## Decision

After careful consideration, we've decided to *test integrated units*. This decision aligns with our goals of achieving good software quality while avoiding excessive effort.
