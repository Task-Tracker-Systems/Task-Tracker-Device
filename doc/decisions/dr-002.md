DR002 Root Directory for the Package's source files {#dr_002}
===================================================

Context
-------

I am not sure in which directory to put the packages: `src` or `lib`.

- IMHO `lib` sounds like source code, which originates from somewhere else and has been added to this project.
- PlatformIO [describes](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/platformio/options/directory/lib_dir.html#lib-dir) the `lib` directory as:
  > You can put your own/private libraries here.

- [@valeros](https://github.com/valeros) (Head of System Integration at PlatformIO Labs) [writes](https://piolabs.com/blog/insights/unit-testing-part-1.html#adding-first-tests)
  > We recommend to split any application into isolated modules and place them into the special `lib` folder in the root of the project.

The packages in question are not planed to be used in other projects.
The packages may have dependencies through well defined interfaces.

What are the consequences of this decision anyway? I am open for comments!

Decision
--------

I think I found an [answer](https://community.platformio.org/t/why-separate-src-and-lib/30509) to the [question](https://github.com/dhebbeker/task-tracker/pull/31#pullrequestreview-1435060978) about whether to put packages (modules) into `src` or `lib` directory.

The PlatformIO documentation [explains](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/advanced/unit-testing/structure/shared-code.html#shared-code):

> By default, PlatformIO does not build the main source code from the [src_dir](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/projectconf/sections/platformio/options/directory/src_dir.html#projectconf-pio-src-dir) folder in pair with a test source code. [...] We recommend splitting the source code into multiple components and placing them into the [lib_dir](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/projectconf/sections/platformio/options/directory/lib_dir.html#projectconf-pio-lib-dir) (projectâ€™s private libraries and components).

Although this is not the only option available for unit tests, but the recommended one.

I infer that:

- there actually is at least one technical difference whether the modules are put into `src` or `lib` directory
- in case unit tests are envisioned for the modules, the recommended way is to put them into the `lib` directory
- the `src/` directory is designated to perform dependency injection for the productive software (in contrast to the test software); compare to "Main Component" for dependency injection ([here](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2021/03/06/ifElseSwitch.html) or in \cite CleanArchitecture).


Summary
-------

Our modules (or packages) shall reside in the projects `lib_dir`: `lib/`
