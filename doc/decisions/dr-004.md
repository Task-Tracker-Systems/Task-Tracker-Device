# DR004 Direct usage of Hardware Abstraction Layer

## Context

Currently we violate the requirement to use libraries and frameworks only through adapters, as it is required by the objectives of the software architecture (see 
[relevant section in Software Architecture](<\ref flexible_structure> "relevant section in Software Architecture"):
We currently use an implementation of the [ArduinoCore-API][ACA] (ACA) as a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) from outside of the adapters layer.
More specifically we use an implementation of the ACA from Espressif coined for ESP32s.

It is generally assumed that using HALs is only necessary from the
[board adapters package](<\ref board_adapters> "board adapters package").

[ACA]: https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API

## Options

There are several options on how to resolve this violation of our own rules.

### Option 1

Abide to the current guidelines.

According to the current state of the software architecture we should use the 3rd party HAL indirectly through adapters.
Those adapters would reside in the 
[3rd party adapters package](<\ref third_party_adapters> "3rd party adapters package").

#### Option 1a)

For an object oriented (OO) variant, defining an interface and inheriting from it, it would require to:

- define one or several interfaces inside the
  [board adapters package](<\ref board_adapters> "board adapters package")
  (header files)
- implement those as adapters inside the
  [3rd party adapters package](<\ref third_party_adapters> "3rd party adapters package")
  (source files)
- define interfaces for the factories (see 
  [dependency injection](<\ref dependency_injection> "dependency injection")
  inside the
  [board adapters package](<\ref board_adapters> "board adapters package")
  (header files)
- implement those factories inside the
  [3rd party adapters package](<\ref third_party_adapters> "3rd party adapters package")
  (source files)

This is the usual way dependency injection and therefore the 
[dependency rule](<\ref interpretation_dependency_rule> "dependency rule")
is implemented.

#### Option 1b)

Instead of using an object oriented approach using inheritance, one could create an interface to the HAL based on free functions.

This option would require to:

- define one or several interfaces (function declarations) inside the
  [board adapters package](<\ref board_adapters> "board adapters package")
  (header files)
- if the build configuration (see `ldf_mode`) requires it, one may have to define proxy headers 
  [3rd party adapters package](<\ref third_party_adapters> "3rd party adapters package")
  (source files)

#### Option 1c)

A hybrid approach (OO and free functions) is also possible.
This would fit well to the ACA as is also consists of classes and free functions.

The steps required would be a mixture of those of options 1a) and 1b).
