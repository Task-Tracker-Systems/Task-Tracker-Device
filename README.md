# Task Tracker

This repository contains the software and hardware sources for a task time recording device.

The purpose of this device is to provide a tool to track time which is used on tasks, in a handy way.

The user shall be able to start and stop the time recording for tasks using a simple press.
Implementation as a device - in contrast to pure software - shall provide the user a distraction free and permanently visible, dedicated interface.
The system shall offer to track a flexible number of tasks.
For quick access, a small number of tasks can be defined as favorites. 
Tasks shall be identifiable using at least a short label.
It is not a goal to display a full task description to the user.

In particular the objectives of the device are:

 - quick interaction with an easy human-machine interface
 - permanent feedback on which task is active at the moment
 - provide digital interface to recorded times (TBD: through WiFi, Bluetooth, wired serial interface, ...)
